# Auto Save, Version Control and Recovery

# macOS

On macOS, the operation system will schedule auto save operation for document-based apps, like Typora or TextEdit. So "auto-save" is always enabled as a system feature.

![general](/assets/images/drag-img.gif)

If you want Typora to auto save content when quit or close, without popping up a confirm dialog, please **uncheck** the checkbox one.

If you want Typora to restore all windows/documents when restart, please **uncheck** the checkbox two.
